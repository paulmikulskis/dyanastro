# Chat GPT-4 Can Hallucinate 

If you've been around long enough to remember the movie I,Robot (y'know the one with Will Smith) then you've definitely been keeping an eye artificial intelligence, and you've probably heard of GPT-3, the AI language model with its incredible ability to generate human-like text, write poetry, and even code. Now with the announcement of GPT-4, let's take a look at a statement from Sam Altman back on January 18th. 

### "People are begging to be disappointed and they will be. The hype is just like... We don’t have an actual AGI and that’s sort of what’s expected of us.”


[An over-exaggerated graph went viral on twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexHormozi/status/1612913266195587072), showing the comparison in the number of parameters in GPT-3 (175 billion) to GPT-4 (100 trillion). Which Altman was compelled to call "complete bullshit" on. A Twitter user chimed in on the matter, remarking that the technology seems to be "slightly overhyped."

##  So What's Changed Since January 18th? 

GPT-3 had 100 million active users two months after launch, [which is the fastest record growth for a consumer application ever.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/#:~:text=Feb%201%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20ChatGPT,a%20UBS%20study%20on%20Wednesday.) 

ChatGPT, which OpenAI released in November 2022, was built upon the GPT-3.5 language model and faced certain word and character limitations. Enter GPT-4: OpenAI's latest model boasting enhanced word support and an impressive capacity to process up to 25,000 words with enhanced precision, context, and creativity. Be advised, however, that ChatGPT may still encounter challenges when handling requests exceeding 500 words or 4,000 characters, [potentially resulting in abrupt, midsentence endings.](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/easily-bypass-the-chatgpt-word-limit/)

## Companies Leveraging GPT-4's Power

This model is now available for ChatGPT Plus subscribers and these 3rd party partners via API:

[Duolingo] (https://blog.khanacademy.org/harnessing-ai-so-that-all-students-benefit-a-nonprofit-approach-for-equal-access/ is using GPT-4 to deepen conversations with users. No more awkward, robotic language practice, now for the first time in history we're getting engaging, lifelike interactions.

[Khan Academy](https://blog.khanacademy.org/harnessing-ai-so-that-all-students-benefit-a-nonprofit-approach-for-equal-access/)has also jumped on the GPT-4 bandwagon, offering personalized, one-on-one tutoring in subjects like math, computer science, and more. Imagine having a virtual tutor that can adapt to your learning style and help you ace those exams!

[Be My Eyes](https://openai.com/customer-stories/be-my-eyes), a free app that connects blind and low-vision people with sighted volunteers. By integrating GPT-4 with their Virtual Volunteer, users can send images to get detailed descriptions, analyze contents, and even receive step-by-step guides for cooking with the ingredients in their fridge. 

Microsoft's revamped [Bing](https://www.bing.com/new) search engine.

## So What Am I Begging to Be Disappointed About, Sam?   

OpenAI has undergone through considerable changes in the past few months, and has exceeded multiple expectactions; a testament to the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence when provided with ample resources to do so. 

Despite these advancements in GPT-4, it still shares limitations with earlier models, such as being unreliable, prone to hallucinations, and possessing biases in its output.

### "You can’t rely on these kinds of models because there’s so much hallucination"

The model's training process is an enigma, and  has showered apprehensions upon researchers like Sasha Luccioni,
["You don’t know what the data is. So you can’t improve it. I mean, it’s just completely impossible to do science with a model like this,”](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00816-5) she comments on the how model's inability to access the internet, and lacking the knowledge of events beyond September 2021 causes inaccuracies. 

As GPT-4 redefines our interaction with AI, it's crucial to address its limitations and harness its power responsibly since these systems are entirely owned by Big Tech. 

In a bid to tackle these concerns, these scientists are hosting a high-powered summit at the University of Amsterdam on April 11, bringing together brainiacs from the likes of UNESCO's science-ethics committee, OECD, and the World Economic Forum. The future of AI hangs in the balance!
