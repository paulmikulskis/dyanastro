### Weekly Venture Tabloid

The U.S. government is about to throw some major shade at China's access to advanced technology, not just Tiktok. They're putting a ring on it and proposing investment restrictions that could affect not just the millions of teens and influencers who use the Chinese platform but also venture capitalists, who have been making moves in the Chinese market. We're talking no more TikTok investments, people! 

Let's break down what this means for investment firms and the broader economic barriers being built with China.

>What are the investment restrictions?

The U.S. government is planning to restrict American dollars used to finance the development of advanced technologies within China's borders.
The restrictions will likely prohibit outright investments in sensitive areas such as quantum computing, advanced semiconductors, and certain artificial intelligence capabilities with military or surveillance applications.
Companies will be required to report more information to the government about their planned investments in certain adversarial countries.
Investment restrictions are intended to prevent U.S. capital from flowing into areas that support China's military and human rights abuses.

>Who will be affected?

Most notably General Atlantic, which has invested nearly $7 billion in China since 2000, with more than 34 portfolio companies in the country, is one of the most high-profile investment firms with a significant presence in the Chinese market. ByteDance, the parent company of the social media app TikTok, has found itself in the cross hairs of the debate over how to manage U.S.-Chinese financial ties.

Other venture firms, which seed earlier-stage companies, have been particularly active in the region. 
According to data compiled by Pitchbook:
* GGV Capital did 105 deals from 2021 to 2022; GSR Ventures did 95. 
* Tiger Global Management, which did 27 deals in the same period. Intel’s venture capital firm did 17 deals in the same period, while Qualcomm’s venture arm did 16.
* Blackstone, KKR, Sequoia, Carlyle Group, Bain Capital, Silver Lake, General Atlantic, and Warburg Pincus.
* The Rhodium Group, U.S. investors have been carrying out about 3,000 transactions per year in China with about 500 of those valued at more than $1 million.
* U.S. companies spent about $11 billion in 2022 buying or investing in Chinese companies, according to the data service firm Dealogic. While that is a small slice of the more than $1.5 trillion that U.S. companies invested globally that year, China deals are still considered valuable because they may provide venture firms access to innovation and, possibly, their next big win.
* Venture firms, which seed earlier-stage companies, have been particularly active in the region. According to data compiled by Pitchbook, for example, the investment firm GGV Capital did 105 deals from 2021 to 2022; GSR Ventures did 95. Other notable names on the list include Tiger Global Management, which did 27 deals in the same period. Intel’s venture capital firm did 17 deals in the same period, while Qualcomm’s venture arm did 16.

>Notable observations in the U.S. Tech sector
With venture capitalists turning their dollar slightly away from the Chinese markets, homegrown opportunities become more incentivized.
