### How Will the Biden Administration's Restrictions on China Affect the World's Largest Game Company? 

Hey there, fellow gamers! Have you heard about Tencent? This Chinese company is quietly building an empire, and you might not even know it yet. They're the brains behind WeChat, one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, and QQ.com, which is one of the largest web portals out there. Oh, and they also own the majority of China's music services, with a whopping 841 million active users!

The Biden administration has recently imposed restrictions on China's access to certain technologies, and this could have a major impact on Tencent's plans for global domination. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the lines between countries and industries are blurring - and that means big changes could be on the horizon for Tencent, a behemoth lurking in the shadows of the tech industry. 

But here's where it gets really interesting: Tencent is also the world's BIGGEST game company. That's right, they're the ones behind the insanely popular Honor of Kings, the Chinese version of League of Legends and Peacekeeper Elite, the Chinese version of PUBG. And they're not stopping there. They're on a mission to create a sprawling digital universe, their own version of the metaverse.

Are you wondering how it’s possible you’ve been a gamer your whole life and never heard about Tencent? Yeah, me too. And that’s because Tencent is [“a ‘silent’ investor.”](https://www.ft.com/content/422e3bd4-6c0c-493c-b888-883d331a89b9) Slippery-snaking their way into over three dozen international video game companies while [Beijing is increasingly adding more restrictions to Chinese youth’s access to entertainment](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/china-games-trade-body-calls-for-more-restrictions-on-minors-playing-video-games) 

So what’s next for Tencent? With Biden imposing restrictions on China's access to certain technology, how will this affect Tencent's expansion plans? As the world's biggest game company, will it be able to weather the storm or will it suffer major setbacks?

### Tencent's Gaming Empire and Controversies

Tencent may not be a household name in the West, but in China, it's a tech giant with an empire to match. With over 1.2 billion monthly active users on WeChat, it's clear that Tencent's influence extends far beyond gaming. However, it's in the world of gaming where Tencent truly reigns supreme.

By revenue, Tencent is the world's largest video game publisher, raking in approximately $6.7 billion in Q4 of 2020. Online games make up a major portion of its profits at 32%, and many of those products target mobile players in the domestic Chinese market. These include Peacekeeper Elite and the wildly popular Honor of Kings, which is the dominant MOBA game in China. Then there is Riot Games’ League of Legends, a game that is now Tencent’s flagship PC game in China, and whose studio was also completely bought out by Tencent, with the firm finalizing its purchase of Riot Games in 2015.

According to [research firm Niko Partners](https://nikopartners.com/tencents-silent-pursuit-of-global-gaming-domination/), Tencent closed one games deal every 2.5 days for most of the first half of 2021.

Tencent may be a powerhouse in the gaming industry, but it's not immune to controversy. Accusations of plagiarism have been leveled against Tencent, with many of its products and services being largely similar to those of its competitors. One of Tencent's fiercest critics is Jack Ma Yun, the co-founder of tech conglomerate Alibaba, who has said that 

## "the problem with Tencent is the lack of innovation; all of their products are copies." 

Some of Tencent's critics have even given it the moniker "Copy to China" for its propensity to imitate its competitors' products and services. 
QQ.com, their instant messaging service looks like a clone of AOL's ICQ, and the company lost an intellectual property lawsuit against AOL in 1998. Tencent's e-commerce platform has also been deemed suspiciously similar to Chinese site Meituan. This culture of imitation is prevalent in the Chinese tech scene, but Tencent's transgressions have been more egregious than most. 

In 2017, videos surfaced of female Tencent employees being asked to unscrew water bottle caps using their thighs during a company event. The incident sparked outrage on social media, and Tencent issued a statement on Zhihu, apologizing for the incident.

In 2018, a former employee filed a complaint against Tencent for firing her after she reported being sexually harassed by her boss. The case brought attention to the issue of sexual harassment in China's tech industry, and Tencent has since pledged to take steps to prevent and address sexual harassment in its workplace.

Yet, these controversies have yet to stem Tencent's investment fervor. The company has invested in over three dozen international gaming companies to date, including Riot Games and Grinding Gear Games, the studio behind Path of Exile.

*They even have an 'undisclosed' amount of Roblox.*

Tencent's position as the world's largest video game publisher has not gone unnoticed by the US government, with Biden's push to restrict China's access to certain access to technology. 

### The question remains: how will these restrictions affect Tencent's gaming empire?

Tencent's investments have drawn the scrutiny of the U.S. government, with concerns over the company's ties to the Chinese government and potential national security risks. Epic Games' CEO, Tim Sweeney, felt compelled to address Tencent's investment in his company on Twitter, including rumors about [how the Epic Games Store is covert spyware used to steal personal data.](https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1113963223517138949)

For Tencent, this could mean losing access to the American market, which is a key part of its international expansion strategy. It could also mean losing access to the technology and expertise of its Western partners, which would make it more difficult for the company to compete on a global scale. The impact of these restrictions on Tencent's bottom line could be significant, as the company relies heavily on its gaming and entertainment divisions for revenue.

The situation is still developing, and it remains to be seen exactly what the Biden administration's restrictions on China will mean for Tencent. However, it's clear that the company will need to navigate a complex and changing regulatory landscape if it wants to continue its global expansion.

As Tencent's CEO Pony Ma Huateng said, "Our vision is to create a virtual world that is parallel to the real world." It's time to buckle up and see where this ride takes us.
