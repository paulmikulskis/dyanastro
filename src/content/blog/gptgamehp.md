AI has the power to generate game scenarios and create personalized gaming experiences that were previously unimaginable. With the rise of AI technology, game developers have been given the ability to create more complex games and challenges that can engage and captivate players on a whole new level.

ChatGPT has a proven track record of being able to output code that works. Back in December 2022, an 11-year-old boy created a game using ChatGPT, but he didn't use code. This text-based adventure game has attracted thousands of players and has been featured on the front page of Reddit.

Set in the world of Harry Potter, the game starts with the player having 100 health and giving options (A, B, C, and D) for their choices. The player can change scenes and locations as they wish, adding additional options as they go along. Depending on the player's choices, the scenario can be different every time they play.

To start the game, you have to type the prompt: 

> “You are a text-based video game where you give me options (A, B, C, and D) as my choices. The setting is Harry Potter. I start out with 100 health.” 

You can change scenes and locations as you wish, add additional options, etc.
