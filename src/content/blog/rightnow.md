It's a bird, it's a plane, it's...a Chinese balloon putting Big Tech investors on edge! 

The Biden administration is planning to slap investment curbs on U.S. firms in China, which could impact financing for advanced technologies like a karate chop to the pocketbook. With the recent rising tensions between the U.S. and China, there's a new layer of complexity to investing in these tech titans. 

China's access to advanced technology is under scrutiny, and U.S. investors are left wondering how that could affect their holdings. Will investing in the likes of Apple, Amazon, and Google be like playing a game of Jenga, where one wrong move could bring everything crashing down?
And how did the COVID-19 pandemic play a crucial part in the potential benefits and drawbacks of investing in the industry?
Let's dive into ups and down on investing in Big Tech in this new era of geopolitical complexity.

Big Tech has always been around, but with the COVID-19 pandemic having a profound impact on the industry, we saw companies reach explosive growths. 

Amazon's delivery and e-commerce services saw a massive surge in demand as more people turned to online shopping during lockdowns. The company's revenue *increased by 38%* in 2020 compared to the previous year, with net sales reaching *$386 billion.*

Zoom, with its video conferencing platform. The company's user base skyrocketed from 10 million daily meeting participants in December 2019 to over 300 million in April 2020. Zoom's revenue *increased by 355%* in 2020 compared to the previous year, with total revenue reaching *$2.65 billion.*

Big Tech as a whole has weathered the pandemic well.  According to a report by the [Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF)](https://itif.org/), the tech industry is one of the few sectors that has seen significant growth, with tech-related jobs accounting for more than 7% of all U.S. jobs. 

As we move towards a post-pandemic world, it will be important to monitor the long-term effects of these changes on the industry and its' investors, as well as the potential risks and opportunities that lie ahead. 

Being no stranger to controversy and scrutiny as seen in recent years, there has been a growing concern over the power and influence of Big Tech. From data privacy concerns to antitrust lawsuits, the industry has faced a range of regulatory challenges all around the World. 

This includes the *second* antitrust lawsuit against Google filed by the Department of Justice on [January 2023](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies). While the EU has set high standards for data privacy protections and introduced new regulations to limit the power of Big Tech, lawmakers are now proposing bills to address data privacy, antitrust, and the spread of misinformation online.

The U.S. government is now preparing to limit investments that American firms can make in China, particularly in areas like advanced computing, with the Treasury Department reaching out to the EU to ensure they do not provide similar financing to China; like two parents agreeing to cut off their kid's allowance.

This is because of the growing concern surrounding China's military and economic ambitions and are considering efforts to restrict Beijing's access to advanced technologies that could pose a National Security threat.
With China simultaneously being one of America's largest trading partners and a primary geopolitical rival; how will this move fundamentally alter the financial relationship between the two countries?

These tensions add to the regulatory challenges faced by Big Tech. Some industry experts have raised concerns that the [restrictions on US firms investing](insertlinkonVentureFirms) in China could lead to retaliation from Beijing against American companies, affecting their market access and potential growth.

## Stocks with notable exposure to China that could be affected by the new regulations:
* [Apple] generates around 20% of its revenue from China, and many of its products are manufactured there. The company has also faced criticism for complying with Chinese government censorship and surveillance practices.
* [Tesla] has invested heavily in China, with a Gigafactory in Shanghai that produces Model 3 and Model Y vehicles for the local market. However, the company has also faced scrutiny over safety concerns and data privacy issues in China.
* [Facebook] and [Google] have both been blocked in China for years, but they still have business ties to the country. Facebook has reportedly been working on a censorship tool to comply with Chinese regulations, while Google has faced criticism for reportedly developing a censored search engine for China.
* [Bytedance](https://www.wsj.com/articles/general-atlantic-sequoia-capital-are-key-drivers-in-oracle-bid-for-tiktok-11598310734), the parent company of TikTok, has also found itself in the crosshairs of the debate over how to manage US-Chinese financial ties.

It's not the first time the US government has made efforts to restrict China's access to advanced technologies and investments, citing national security concerns. These efforts have targeted companies such as [Huawei, which has been blacklisted by the US government and banned from doing business with US companies.](https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-google-android-ban-988382/) 

It ain't all doom and gloom though, as many big tech companies are continuing to invest in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing. In particular, AI [(whom the U.S. is currently leading in)](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-results-show-its-growing-lead-ai-chip-race-2023-02-23/), has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries, from healthcare to finance to transportation. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM are already investing heavily and are rated TOP in AI research and development.

As the U.S. continues to navigate its relationship with China and grapple with the challenges of emerging technologies, it's clear that Big Tech remains a critical player in this future-is-now World.
