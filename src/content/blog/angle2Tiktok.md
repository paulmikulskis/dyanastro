Attention, Tiktokers! 
Biden's ramping up his efforts to mitigate the risk of economic and military threats from China, which includes a possible TikTok ban. 

Yep, you read that right. 

The app that brought you endless hours of mindless scrolling and viral dance challenges could be on the chopping block. In fact, there's already been a [federal ban on TikTok for government devices](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1143/actions), and several states have followed suit with similar restrictions. 

But it doesn't stop there. 

A [bipartisan bill is currently under review](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/3876321-tiktok-ban-makes-progress-toward-president/), which would give the President the power to ban TikTok and other apps that transfer sensitive personal data to anyone connected with China. Yes. The same President [who dropped the last one's bill to ban tiktok)](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57413227) is now pushing for the same goal.

### Why Did Biden Change His Mind?

There is a broader push to mitigate the risk of economic and military threats from China, and TikTok has become a symbol of these threats, with calls to hold China accountable and build up alliances with other countries. There are concerns that the Chinese Communist Party could use data from TikTok, owned by the Chinese company Bytedance, to obtain sensitive personal information on millions of Americans. 

Tiktok's privacy policy permits for the following collection of data: 
* Names, ages, phone numbers, and emails when people sign up for the service.
* Approximate locations and mobile device identifiers, such as IP addresses.
* Insights into users' interests based on the videos or accounts they've previously liked or followed.
* Keystroke patterns may be used solely for anti-fraud and spam purposes.
* Biometric information such as locating a person's face to apply an effect, but those features do not uniquely identify individuals

....Mmmh, that's a lot of data just to watch videos. Acccording to [Pew Research Center's data](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/08/10/teens-social-media-and-technology-2022/), the app's audience is comprised of mostly teens. 67% of teens, in fact, claimed Tiktok as their go-to application for entertainment.  

*"How unsure of itself can the world’s top superpower be to fear a young people’s favorite app like that?"* said Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning in a [recent press briefing.](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/202302/t20230228_11032907.html)

So then, why is Biden pushing so hard to ban Tiktok? It's just a dancing app for teens right? Well, let me tell you something you probably don't know...

* [TikTok's parent company, Bytedance, had personnel in China use the app to track the locations of journalists who were writing stories about TikTok's national security risks.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/22/technology/byte-dance-tik-tok-internal-investigation.html)

* [TikTok officials secretly tried to find out more information about the Oracle servers that the government was using to protect against security risks on the app. They wanted to know the locations of those servers to try to get around those protections.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2022/11/30/tiktok-chinese-state-media-divisive-politics/?sh=587bda3e4bf0)

* [TikTok has been engaged in a multi-year campaign to mislead U.S. officials and the American public about the threats it poses.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2022/11/30/tiktok-chinese-state-media-divisive-politics/?sh=587bda3e4bf0)

Despite Tiktok's inability to stay out of the crosshairs of these geopolitical tensions, they are vigilante in their defense that the company never shares data from American users, and Chinese government officials can't access it. At a [hearing in September](https://apnews.com/article/technology-china-united-states-national-security-government-and-politics-ac5c29cafaa1fc6bee990ed7e1fe5afc) 
TikTok Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Pappas simply said,*"We will never share data, period."*

That's not very reassuring, if you ask me, as they have a proven track record of putting the U.S. government and other countries on their tip-toes. 

Still, the threat of a nationwide ban (again) looms large, sending shockwaves through the online community. It looks like there's a real chance that TikTok could be banned this time, which could have significant implications for both influencers and investors. 

Imagine waking up one day to find that your go-to app for entertainment, inspiration, and communication is suddenly gone. And for those who've built careers and audiences on TikTok, the prospect of losing that platform could be devastating. But it's not just the TikTok stars who could be affected, investors are also taking the heat. 

With so much uncertainty in the air, it's hard to say what the future holds for TikTok and its users. Will the app survive the latest crackdown on China? Or will we all have to find a new way to pass the time? Only time will tell.
