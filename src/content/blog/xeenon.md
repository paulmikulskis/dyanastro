# Xeenon: Is Twitch Dead? 

While browsing Twitter comments about [Twitch's new Ad guidelines](https://kotaku.com/twitch-branded-content-rules-streaming-ads-revenue-1850512350), I stumbled upon Xeenon.xyz, a streaming platform that operates on the blockchain. It offers a unique concept of paying in ETH just for streaming on the platform. Could this actually be an alternative to Twitch's current state?

 Now, I know you might be a bit skeptical – it’s healthy and I like that about you. But let’s gather some braincells and dive into this together.

## What is Xeenon?

Xeenon is a Web3 streaming platform. Yeah, I know, Web3, crypto... can be a little intimidating. But, it's easier than you think. This platform's been built on top of the Arbitrum and Livepeer Networks, which simply means that they are using the advantages of blockchain technology, like better security, lower fees, and instant payments, which can benefit streamers and their audiences. 

It was developed by Graviton, a company aiming for a 'Collab Economy' where creators and fans thrive together. They're making this possible with their Creator Revenue Sharing Model (CRSM) that lets creators earn from the get-go, sidestepping the usual reliance on ads and fan payments. Graviton spent most of 2022 setting the foundation, building the front end of Xeenon, and creating an integrated payment system. 

## What is Xeenon's Strategy For Paying New Streamers?

Xeenon's Creator Revenue Sharing Model (CRSM) seems to offers a fresh approach to streaming that rewards creators from day one. They're giving streamers a cut of their earnings. But how does this work, exactly?

Here's the deal: Xeenon operates something called an Orchestrator on the Livepeer network. This Orchestrator earns ETH by doing video transcoding jobs. Xeenon has set their Fee Cut (the portion of earnings they keep) at 60%, and their Reward Cut (the extra they earn as rewards) at 15%. They're sharing that juicy 60% Fee Cut with creators. Yes, they are paying you in ETH based on your streaming time.

Now, before you rush to grab your crypto wallet, hold on a minute. Xeenon's got you covered even if you're new to the crypto scene. They've integrated with [Privy.io](https://www.privy.io/about), so you can start earning right away without needing to fiddle around with a crypto wallet. Of course, for those who are into it, traditional crypto-wallet routes are also available.

## What Does Blockchain Have To do With Streaming?

**Decentralization:** By utilizing the blockchain, Xeenon creates a system that is not controlled by any single entity, providing an equal playing field for all streamers. It's a shift from the traditional model where platforms like Twitch dictate the rules.

**Transparency:** Blockchain's open ledger system offers unparalleled transparency. Every transaction, including payments to creators in ETH, is recorded and can be verified by anyone. 

**Security:** Blockchain's immutable and cryptographic nature provides a secure environment where transactions and data are highly resistant to hacking and fraud.

**Low Fees & Instant Payments:** The use of the Arbitrum blockchain allows for low transaction fees. This means that more of the earnings go directly to the creators. Payments are also processed instantaneously, a significant upgrade from traditional platforms where payout periods can be lengthy.

**Incorporation of DAI:** DAI, a stablecoin cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the US Dollar, can be integrated into the system. This provides stability against the notorious volatility of cryptocurrencies, ensuring that streamers' earnings don't fluctuate wildly with market swings.

**Tokenization Opportunities:** Xeenon can potentially introduce unique tokenization features for the community. Streamers can mint their own tokens representing digital assets or even stake in their streaming channels, opening up new ways for fan interaction and monetization.

## Time Will Tell

At the end of the day, skepticism is healthy, especially when it comes to new platforms in the digital space. But Xeenon's approach to revenue sharing, its commitment to instant payments, and its ambitious future plans make it a promising entrant in the world of streaming platforms. 

Their straightforward, [walk-through manuals](https://docs.xeenon.xyz/)  make account setup and understanding payment mechanics a breeze, clearing the fog that often comes with Web3 and crypto-related platforms. It might just be worth giving it a shot. I know I'm curious. After all, who wouldn't want to get paid to stream?

What are your thoughts about Xeenon's approach to content streaming? Would you consider switching platforms?
